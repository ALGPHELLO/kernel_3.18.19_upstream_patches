# Kernel 3.18.19 Upstream Patches

These official collection of kernel patches are hosted by https://www.kernel.org/

They all are downloaded from https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.x/incr/
___
For using directly into kernel source, I unpacked the compressed source and renamed so as to merge as patch scripts.

Apply the patches one by one in exact serial.
